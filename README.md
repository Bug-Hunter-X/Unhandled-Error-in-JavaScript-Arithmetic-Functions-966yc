This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: unhandled errors.  The initial `bug.js` file contains arithmetic functions that don't fully handle potential errors.  The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to improve the error handling to make the code more robust and prevent unexpected crashes.  This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in production-ready JavaScript code.  Always consider potential edge cases and exceptional situations to build reliable applications.
